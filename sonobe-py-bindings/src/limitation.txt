What's Real vs. Simplified:
REAL (Actual Cryptography):

✅ Arkworks Witness<F> type
✅ Arkworks serialization/deserialization
✅ BN254 field elements
✅ Type validation through deserialization
Simplified (Due to API Limitations):

⚠️ Folding logic doesn't call Folding::prove() because:
Witness fields (w, r_w) are private
Would need R1CS constraint system
Would need Poseidon transcript setup
Would need commitment scheme parameters
To Get FULL R1CS-Based Folding:
You would need to:

Add public getters to 
Witness
 in folding-schemes (pub fn get_w(), pub fn get_r_w())
Expose R1CS construction from Python
Set up Poseidon transcript
Call Folding::prove() with all parameters
